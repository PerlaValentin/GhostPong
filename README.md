<bold>Ghost Pong - Twist to classic Pong Game</bold>

This project was developed to demonstrate skills in Javascript and front-end development. Initial goal was to create a classic Pong game that has to run on a phone or a tablet browser with two player game on one device. Project required basic UI but I decided to give it a little twist and make it Ghost theme (cat vs Ghost)
